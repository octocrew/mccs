## Plugins

- [Grief Prevention](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/griefprevention.1884/)
  - Allows users to create claims to protect their builds.
  - Everything inside the claim can not be destroyed by players without `/trust`.
  - Claim owner can give varying levels of claim access/trust.
- [Core Protect](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/)
  - Logs actions in game (blocks, chests, etc.) and allows rollback/recovery to varying degrees.
  - Currently used to allow rollback on blocks due to cheaters but not due to griefing.
- [LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/)
  - Allows admins to create groups and give permissions of plugin commands on the server.
- [HomeSpawn](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/homespawn.14108/)
  - Allows a user to teleport to their home using the `/home [name]` command.
  - Allows a user to teleport to spawn using the `/spawn` command.

## Datapacks

- [Craftable Shulker Shells: "Shulker Shell Shuffle"](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/shulker-shell-shuffle)
  - Makes endermen drop chorus fruit
  - Adds recipe for shulker shells by using popped chorus fruit in a helmet pattern
  - Adds recipe for one ender pearl from a one chorus fruit
  - Recipes are added to the recipe book
- [Multiplayer Precentage Sleeping System](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/tree/master/multiplayer_sleep)
  - Allows a percentage of users to sleep instead of all players.
  - Rounds down (for example: 5 players online with 50% sleep only requires 2 to sleep).
  - Clear the weather for 999,999 seconds every time night is skipped (Not normal behavior. Can be changed back to normal behavior.).
  - Does **not** interfere with the phatnom timer.
  - Only considers players in the overworld for sleep.
  - Adds to time instead of resetting it to help with in-game days/time played.
- [Dragon Drops](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
  - Makes the ender dragon drop a dragon egg and elytra on every death.
- [Double Shulker Shells](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
